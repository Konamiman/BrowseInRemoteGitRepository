v1.8  2018-09-22

- Fix: commands not working for files with spaces in the name (filename wasn't surrounded with quotes when passed to git ls-files).
- Fix: generated urls for multiline selections created from the bottom end with "L(last line)-L(first line)", and are therefore not rendered properly in the browser.
- Fix: invalid url generated for unmerged files.


v1.7  2017-09-10

- If the command is executed over a multiline text selection, the url will end with "#Lstart-Lend", thus rendering these lines as selected in the browser.
- git rev-parse is now used instead of git branch to get the current branch name (except if there's a rebase in progress, see below)
- Best-effort rebase-in-progress support implemented: if git rev-parse gives "HEAD" as the current branch name, git branch is used, then a line with the format "* (no branch, rebasing branchname)" is searched for in the output, and the branch name is extracted from there.


v1.6  2017-05-30

- git rev-parse is now used instead of git status to check if the current solution is living in a repository, much faster and prevents VS from hanging if there is a lot of pending changes


v1.5  2017-02-17

- git ls-files is now used to get the file paths and names as they exist in the repository, this prevents issues when there is a casing mismatch with the name that appears in the project file.


v1.4  2017-01-19

- SSH base URLs are now automatically converted to HTTPS, no need to manually configure it


v1.3  2017-01-16

- Added support for Visual Studio 2017


v1.2  2017-01-11

- Fix: context menu entries appearing even if the files are not in a Git repository
- Fix: line number being included in the generated url whenever the file is open in code editor, even if menu entry is clicked from solution explorer
- Fix: context menu entries not appearing in code editor for .css, .less, .scss, .json, .md, .asp, .wsf and .xaml files


v1.1  2017-01-10

- Fix: context menu entries not appearing in code editor for .cshtml files
- Fix: context menu entries not appearing in solution explorer when using "Open Web Site"
